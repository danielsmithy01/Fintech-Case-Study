# Fintech Case Study: Klarna


## *Overview and Origin*

Klarna was incorportated in 2005 by Sebestian Siemiatkowski and Niklas Adalberth. They participated in the Stockholm School of Economics annual entrepreneurship award in 2005 with their idea, however their idea was not enthusiastically received and their entry was among the last in the competition; despite this they chose to create the company, an angel investor then appeared and decided to invest in them and their project whilst putting them in touch with a team of programmers to help them build the platform.    It's aim at the time of creating was to make it easier for people to shop online. Klarna has raised a total of $3.7 billion over the 17 years it has existed, it is funded by 66 investors.

## *Business Activities*

Klarna's mission has stayed the same since it's creation in 2005 which was to 'make it easier for people to shop online'; technology has evolved significantly since the company was founded so now their mission while it still remains the same, it is a bit different; Klarna now wants to 'make paying as simple as possible'. According to the Klarna websites TMD; it's target audience is people who want to purchase goods and services online that wish to defer or split their payment in 4. Klarna allows a short term credit deferral option that lets the consumer spread the cost of 'what they love to buy'. It's main competitor is AfterPay which has dominated the BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) domain since it's inception in 2014. The main plus in the corner of Klarna in the battle of these two companies is the fact that Klarna can be used at any retailer whether they offer BNPL as an option or not while AfterPay is limited to only 48,000 retailers/merchants. The technologies that Klarna are currently implenting are JavaScript, Python, Node.js, React, Java, TypeScript, Amazon EC2, React Native, GraphQL, AWS Lambda, Kafka, Scala and Erlang.
