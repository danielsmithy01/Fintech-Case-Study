# Fintech Case Study: Klarna


## *Overview and Origin*

Klarna was incorportated in 2005 by Sebestian Siemiatkowski and Niklas Adalberth. They participated in the Stockholm School of Economics annual entrepreneurship award in 2005 with their idea, however their idea was not enthusiastically received and their entry was among the last in the competition; despite this they chose to create the company, an angel investor then appeared and decided to invest in them and their project whilst putting them in touch with a team of programmers to help them build the platform.    It's aim at the time of creating was to make it easier for people to shop online. Klarna has raised a total of $3.7 billion over the 17 years it has existed, it is funded by 66 investors.

## *Business Activities*

Klarna's mission has stayed the same since it's creation in 2005 which was to 'make it easier for people to shop online'; technology has evolved significantly since the company was founded so now their mission while it still remains the same, it is a bit different; Klarna now wants to 'make paying as simple as possible'. According to the Klarna websites TMD; it's target audience is people who want to purchase goods and services online that wish to defer or split their payment in 4. Klarna allows a short term credit deferral option that lets the consumer spread the cost of 'what they love to buy'. It's main competitor is AfterPay which has dominated the BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) domain since it's inception in 2014. The main plus in the corner of Klarna in the battle of these two companies is the fact that Klarna can be used at any retailer whether they offer BNPL as an option or not while AfterPay is limited to only 48,000 retailers/merchants. The technologies that Klarna are currently implenting are JavaScript, Python, Node.js, React, Java, TypeScript, Amazon EC2, React Native, GraphQL, AWS Lambda, Kafka, Scala and Erlang.

## *Landscape*

The fintech domain that Klarna fits into mainly is payments and billing. Over the past 10 years, fintech has allowed the archaic system of payments to be completely overthrown. The massive changes include real time payments, contactless payments, near instant approval on loans and the very payment method that Klarna uses which is BNPL. One of the more recent trends is the fade out of cash in Australia's financial ecosystem; while cash will always be used in the latest RBA Customer survey it found that the porportion of in-person cash payments has dropped from about 75% to 30%. The other major companies in this domain are PayPal, Stripe, Visa, Square, Venmo, Zip and Latitude.

## *Results*

Klarna currently has over 147 million active consumers across the 45 countries it currently operates in. Klarna uses the following core metrics to assess their performance; cost of payment, fraud rates, success rate, chargeback rates. Klarna has a valuation of $45.6 billion while it's main competitor in Australia Afterpay has a valuation of $22 billion; Klarna has an outreach much wider than Afterpay given the 45 countries that it operates in. The customer base in Australia for both these companies are fairly even sitting at about 12 million each but Klarna has a further 135 million users worldwide while Afterpay is still trying to grow in the international market.

## *Recommendations*

Global cashless payment volumes are set to increase by more than 80% by 2025 and in that increase; the amount of consumers that use BNPL services will also increase. The road ahead for BNPL services will be bumpy as heavy regulation will more than likely take place for the industry but in saying that, BNPL services could seriously up their game til they are sitting up there with VISA and Mastercard. Klarna is still a company in it's infancy, trying to find it's footing and working out how to walk on it's own but in 20-30 years Klarna could be one of the world's biggest payment and billing services if it keeps following the trends and innovations of society, BNPL could operate with anything; we could see Klarna offer extensive home loans, car loans, personal loans, holiday loans, student loans and bill payments; in summation the general consensus of 'Pay in 4' that BNPL companies utilize should be dropped in the coming years in order for companies such as Klarna to operate on a larger scale touching all forms of payments making it one of the bigger payment conglomerates. Expanding the business to be able to reach more consumers is what business growth is about; offering more services such as the ones listed above will allow the customer reach to grow from that 147 million base to who knows how much given that 19.4 million Americans and 2.9 million Australian's have some form of personal loan. One way that Klarna could operate this is to buy out one of the leading fintech lending companies such as Reggora or OppFi and take on their staff remotely, this would allow them to use the technology they have already implemented and have remote loan specialist workers under their belt so they wouldn't have to worry about expanding office size whilst still having new workers who specialise in the acquired domain.
